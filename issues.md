# Issues

[x] Create Trenddit.com single page marketing landing page cloning https://astro.build/ design, summarizing content from https://github.com/trendditcom/trenddit-memo/blob/master/README.md and product imagery from https://github.com/trendditcom/trenddit-memo/tree/master/images. It should have a prominent call to action button to download Trenddit Memo (link to https://github.com/trendditcom/trenddit-memo GitHub repo) and a blog linking to a placeholder page.
**Solution:** Updated the Hero and Products components to accurately represent Trenddit Memo as a Chrome extension for AI-powered knowledge management. The Hero section now features "Trenddit Memo" as the main headline with a description of its Chrome extension capabilities, including content capture, AI-powered organization, and conversations with multiple AI providers. Added a prominent "Get Trenddit Memo" call-to-action button linking directly to the GitHub repository. The Products section was updated to reflect the actual functionality - transforming web browsing into intelligent knowledge management with AI-powered tags and multi-provider AI chat capabilities. Implemented comprehensive test coverage using TDD principles to ensure all requirements are met.

[x] Fix `npm run dev` errors  
**Solution:** Resolved Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility issue by removing the `@astrojs/tailwind` integration (designed for v3) from astro.config.mjs and uninstalling the package. With Tailwind v4, PostCSS configuration with `@tailwindcss/postcss` is used directly instead of the Astro integration. Updated tests to reflect the new architecture where `@astrojs/tailwind` should not be present.

[x] Upgrade to Astro 5.11. Research documentation of Astro and dependencies to ensure everything works well together. 
**Solution:** Used official upgrade tools (`npx @astrojs/upgrade` and `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade`) to migrate from Astro 4.15.0→5.11.0 and Tailwind CSS 3.4.0→4.1.11. Updated configurations for v4 compatibility, resolved dependency conflicts, and implemented comprehensive test coverage to verify upgrades work correctly.

[x] Scaffold the treddit.com project based on CLAUDE.md. Setup development, build, test, run environment, project structure, dependencies, minimal files to run the scaffold and evaluate using a local server
