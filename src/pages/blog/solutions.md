By the time I start writing this chapter, Claud 4 is launched. Claude Code has also been updated to integrated directly with VS Code. In order to evaluate the latest capabilities of the model as well as Claude Code, I decide to develop my next project using Anthropic API instead of Bedrock API.

I also want to make some modifications to my vibe coding approach.

**Product Vision First:** Instead of working from a comprehensive requirements and technical design specification, I want to start with a high level product vision first.

**Vibe Friendly Stack:** I also want Claude to recommend a technology stack that is vibe coding friendly.

**Minimum Viable Sprint:** Then I build on this vision and stack by developing the most essential features first.

## Product Vision First

VibeSolver is AI twin of an AWS Solutions Architect. VibeSolver leverages its AWS cloud expertise to help customers reimagine what’s possible for their businesses and generates AWS solutions that drive business growth. Customers can use natural language to describe their business technology requirements. VibeSolver can understand these requirements and generate matching AWS solutions which follow the AWS Well-Architected Framework. VibeSolver enables customers to as easily use natural language to query, change, and deploy these solutions. VibeSolver is also able to visualize solutions as deployment architecture diagrams as well as runtime visual step by step workflows. 

Customers are able to refer the visualizations when querying, modifying, analyzing, and deploying the solutions. Customers can also generate Flash Cards to educate themselves on the overall solution and the individual AWS services involved. Customers are able to conduct what-if analysis based on criteria including latency, scalability, cost, availability, security, etc. They can visualize the what-if analysis results as visual diagrams as well as narrative explanation generated by the AI.

I save this product vision as `specs/product.md` file in the project.


This approach aligns with Trenddit's mission to provide lean AI automation solutions. The Trenddit Memo browser extension exemplifies these principles by enabling knowledge workers to capture, organize, and interact with information using AI-powered automation.

For organizations looking to implement similar AI-driven workflows, consider how tools like Trenddit Memo can streamline knowledge management and enhance productivity across teams.

## Vibe Friendly Stack

Here is the prompt I use to create the vibe friendly stack definition.

---

Ultrathink to recommend a minimal technical stack for an app which meets the following criteria:

1. The stack is vibe coding friendly using Claude 4 which means the model knows the stack technologies really well and can generate and iterate high quality code with simply natural language instructions
2. The app can run local-first on a mac laptop and can connect to APIs for online services 
3. The stack can use latest AI frameworks, libraries, SDKs with ease 
4. The stack uses minimal lines of code to generate same functionality compared to alternative stacks 
5. The stack uses stable and well documented frameworks, libraries, and packages 
6. The stack is easy and fast to test, build, run, and debug

---

Here is the vibe friendly stack recommended by Claude. I save both the generated stack and prompt as `specs/stack.md` in my project.
### Core Stack

**Runtime & Build:**
- **Node.js** (latest LTS) + **pnpm** - Excellent Claude support, vast ecosystem, fast package management
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast dev server, minimal config, excellent TypeScript support
- **TypeScript** (strict mode) - Type safety with minimal overhead, Claude generates high-quality TS code

**Frontend:**
- **React 18+** with hooks - Claude has deep React knowledge, minimal boilerplate with modern patterns
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first, extremely concise styling, Claude excels at Tailwind generation

**Local Data:**
- **SQLite** with **better-sqlite3** - Perfect for local-first, zero-config, excellent performance
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe, minimal SQL abstraction that Claude handles beautifully

### AI Integration Layer

**AI SDK:**
- **Vercel AI SDK** - Unified interface for multiple providers, streaming support, React hooks

### State & Data Management

**Client State:**
- **Zustand** - Minimal Redux alternative, ~100 lines vs 1000+ with Redux
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management, caching, background updates

**Offline/Sync:**
- **Workbox** (for PWA) - Local-first capabilities

### Development Tools

**Testing:**
- **Vitest** - Fast Vite-native testing, Jest-compatible API
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing with minimal setup

**Code Quality:**
- **ESLint** + **Prettier** - Automated formatting and linting
- **TypeScript strict mode** - Compile-time error catching

### Why This Stack Excels:

1. **Claude-Friendly**: I have extensive knowledge of React/TS/Tailwind patterns and can generate production-quality code
2. **Local-First**: SQLite + Workbox/Tauri enables true offline functionality
3. **AI-Ready**: Vercel AI SDK provides seamless integration with all major AI providers
4. **Minimal Code**: Tailwind utilities, React hooks, and Zustand reduce boilerplate by 60-80%
5. **Battle-Tested**: Every component is mature with excellent documentation
6. **Developer Experience**: Vite's HMR, TypeScript intellisense, and Vitest's speed create a smooth development flow

### Starter Command:

```bash
pnpm create vite my-app --template react-ts 
cd my-app 
pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/openai @anthropic-ai/sdk zustand @tanstack/react-query better-sqlite3 drizzle-orm 
pnpm add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite-plugin-pwa workbox-window npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This stack lets you build complex AI-powered applications with surprisingly few lines of code while maintaining excellent type safety and developer experience. Claude can iterate on this stack extremely effectively due to its deep familiarity with these technologies.


## Design

I also note the specific design requirements for VibeSolver as `specs/design.md` file in the project.

The VibeSolver web app should be designed with latest UI design system to provide a modern, reactive, easy, usable, and visual interface to achieve the intended requirements of the product. The design system and UI is inspired by Figma Infinite Canvas UI where user can design using drag and drop on an infinite canvas and Voiceflow Visual Workflow editor where user can visually connect steps of a workflow and run the workflows step by step (see attached images). Learn more about Figma design canvas here https://www.figma.com/community/file/1387894540487619534/canvas-design-system and VoiceFlow workflow editor here https://www.voiceflow.com/features/workflows.


## Minimum Viable Product

Teams can now generate first sprint for a minimum viable product. These instructions enable both scaffolding the product as well as generating MVP based on roadmap if it exists.

---
**Prompt for generating sprint plan**

Ultrathink to generate the next VibeSolver project sprint using this streamlined approach:

1. ANALYSIS PHASE:
   - IMPORTANT: Read and follow the @specs/ folder for understanding the product vision, design requirements, technical stack, and roadmap if it exists.
   - Review files in sprints/ folder if it exists to understand progression and numbering
   - Review the project code to understand the state of the project
   - Review CLAUDE.md if available to understand code generation guidance
   - For the first sprint focus on setting up the project scaffold, configurations, environment settings, virtual environment, installing dependencies, development and testing tooling
   - IMPORTANT: For every subsequent sprint, follow end-to-end feature-slice approach  (minimum viable product) based on the roadmap if it exists, which includes adequate frontend UI and backend capabilities to help user evaluate all features released in that sprint using the frontend UI.
   - Determine the next sprint number and logical feature focus

2. PLANNING PHASE:
   - Based on your analysis, draft a comprehensive sprint plan
   - IMPORTANT: Follow test-driven development principles for development workflow
   - IMPORTANT: Follow modularity, maintainability, extensibility, and single responsibility principles for code generation
   - Include all required sections:
     * Title with proper sprint number format (e.g., "Sprint 004: Feature Name")
     * Overview explaining purpose and context
     * Clear goals (3-5 bullet points)
     * Detailed tasks with test examples
     * Specific acceptance criteria
     * Development instructions
   - Ensure the sprint builds logically on previous work
   - Verify the sprint delivers actual user value

3. OUTPUT:
   - Save EXACTLY ONE file named '/sprints/[NUMBER]-[feature-name].md' where:
     * [NUMBER] is the three-digit sprint number (e.g., '003', '004')
     * [feature-name] briefly describes the focus area in kebab-case
   - Confirm the file meets project standards and requirements before saving

---


Next I create the slash command `/develop` like so and run it to vibe code the entire sprint.

---
**Prompt for developing a sprint**

Read the sprints/ folder to identify the latest sprint. Review the product code generated so far. Continue developing the product based on the latest spring plan.

---

As I vibe code the first sprint, Practitioners are noticing Claude 4 + direct Anthropic API access + latest Claude Code is running faster than custom Amazon Bedrock integration I tried in earlier iterations for the same project. Remains to be seen if this is to do with remarkably lighter initial context by not providing end-to-end project specifications and requirements upfront. Maybe direct Anthropic API access is just faster. 

Best practices involve note there are no "too many requests" errors during the first sprint. Practitioners are conscious, this is eating into my Claude subscription costs. More on that soon. 

![Image](/images/blog/first-sprint-generation.png)
As I observe the Claude 4 code generation and agent behavior Practitioners are noting several interesting actions including identifying a fixing usual issues this stack leads to including configuration of various dependencies and build errors. I have never experienced one shot build success first time when using similar stack. The stack is complex.

I queried Claude Code on cost of this operation. I noted the lines of code generated with this stack are around 10-15% compared to what was generated in prior project runs (around 1K lines of code vs 7-9K). That is pretty cool validation of the revised workflow to pre-generate the vibe coding friendly tech stack.

```bash
Total cost:            $1.45
     Total duration (API):  8m 9.8s
     Total duration (wall): 20m 56.4s
     Total code changes:    974 lines added, 182 lines removed
     Token usage by model:
         claude-3-5-haiku:  15.5k input, 639 output, 0 cache read, 0 cache write
            claude-sonnet:  248 input, 21.6k output, 3.1m cache read, 49.9k cache write

```

I run tests for the project using the following instructions.

---
**Prompt for running tests and fixing issues**

```


Next I generated a custom code metrics reporting script for this project.

---
**Code metrics reporting script generation**

Ultrathink to create a script in the scripts/ folder to collect metrics on the project code including lines of code, number of modules, lines of comments, number of dependencies, number of tests and types of tests, test coverage. Think of other relevant code metrics as well. The script should save the stats in reports/ folder as timestamped file name in valid markdown format. The report should include well formatted tables by modules and summaries.

---

I compared the same prompt generating report using the prior version of the model. This one is awesome and far superior.  The reason was far better evaluation of input (requirements) and output (report) while iterating through fixing the issues. All done mostly autonomously by the model. I just did the occasional "grant permissions" for commands the `settings.local.json` had not seen yet. The results are what I have been chasing in prior chapters. Beautiful. Period.

      toast.success('AWS solution generated successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error('Failed to generate solution. Please try again.');
    }
  };
}
```

**AI Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
// Structured AI output with Zod validation
export const awsSolutionSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  awsServices: z.array(z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    purpose: z.string(),
    configuration: z.string(),
  })),
  architecture: z.object({
    components: z.array(/* ... */),
    connections: z.array(/* ... */),
  }),
  costEstimate: z.number(),
  recommendations: z.array(z.string()),
});

// ✅ Type-safe AI function with error handling
export async function generateAWSSolution(requirements: string) {
  const result = await generateObject({
    model: anthropic('claude-3-sonnet-20241022'),
    schema: awsSolutionSchema,
    prompt: `As an AWS Solutions Architect...`,
  });
  return result.object; // Fully typed response
}
```

## First Error

I encountered an error (see blank screen). Copied error from the Browser Console to Claude Code.

```

Here is the resulting UI. Seems without styling, layout, etc. Simple fix in my opinion. I captured a screenshot and shared with Claude.

![Image](/images/blog/ui-minus-style.png)

Next round of Claude Code error fixing generates this UI. I provide the UI (errors included) back to Claude for iterating a fix.

![Image](/images/blog/ui-rendering-but-errors.png)

Then I see magic! One round of error fixing and the MVP is feature complete.

![Image](/images/blog/mvp-ui-first-sprint.png)

And when I add a user requirement to "Build scalable landing page for 10,000 users."

![Image](/images/blog/mvp-solution-first-sprint.png)

This is pretty awesome. For the first time in my multiple attempts at vibe coding, Practitioners are able to generate a relatively feature complete app within two sprints. The UI design looks clean and unique. The generated app is mobile-web responsive. Running the app is really fast compared to other stacks. This will help during feature iterations. The code generated is significantly fewer lines of code around 3K compared with prior approaches which reached 11K by second sprint. The code quality score is maintained at 95/100. Code is fairly modular with 43 files of which 21 files are components.

**One interesting observation though.** The app is using Mock AI service to prototype AI service calls! It is pretty convincing until I tried a few prompts and noted the solutions are not matching the requirements. It took another sprint to production-ready the app as a local-first app using Claude 4 for generating solutions.

Here is what the production solution looks like.

![Image](/images/blog/production-solution.png)

And the solution architecture to match.

Teams can also run a what-if analysis on the solution like so...

## Vibe Coding Workflow


The workflow now is fairly streamlined and repeatable as I complete the next few sprints. As Claude Code learns tools where I permit use without asking, each step in the workflow has become almost autonomous. Teams can multi-task while the step is completing without me having to keep a watchful eye.

Here is sprint 4 workflow which added 2,500 lines of code in 19 minutes at $3 cost.

| Command   | What it does                                                 | Lines Added (Removed) | Time Rounded | Cost Rounded |

## Injecting Features and Fixes

I use the `roadmap.md` file to inject new features and solve for bugs I find while evaluating the app.

Here is what the file looks like with few features implemented and few new ones identified for the next sprint. I modified the `develop` slash command to update the roadmap when done. I also added and IMPORTANT step in `sprint` slash command to prioritize roadmap features for next sprint.

Note that in the first feature the code is copied from Claude response to help make VibeSolver production-ready.

---
**Product Feature Roadmap**


[✅] Create a Production-Like Server based on following instructions. Update the specs/stack.md accordingly.

```bash
pnpm add -D express compression helmet
```

Create `server.js`:
```javascript
import express from 'express'
import compression from 'compression'
import helmet from 'helmet'
import path from 'path'

const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.use(helmet())
app.use(compression())
app.use(express.static('dist'))

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve('dist/index.html'))
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Production build running on http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

Then add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve:prod": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

Run with:
```bash
pnpm build
pnpm serve:prod
```

[✅] Solve the CORS issue to make the Anthropic API calls work. Use Vercel AI SDK (https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction) with the tech stack defined in specs/stack.md. Do not create any new dependencies on Vercel Cloud (like functions) or Next.js.

[ ] Increase the height of the architecture diagram canvas to match the width such that it is a square.

[ ] Fix panning when holding an empty part of canvas and dragging.

[ ] Add a "Redraw" button to redraw the diagram to ensure that all features of the diagram are visible with minimal overlap.

[ ] Fix Flashcards generation. Currently it only generates the same two flashcards with answers, spacebar not working to flip and instead it only shows Easy, Medium, Hard tags. When Generate Flashcards is clicked follow error message appears - Anthropic API error: 400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"tools.0.custom.input_schema.type: Input should be 'object'"}}

## Advanced Features

By the sprint 10 Practitioners are building advanced features of VibeSolver including solutions persistence, exporting, sharing, and organization.

Here is the solutions library feature which enables me to organize, search, and edit solutions I saved after generation.

![Image](/images/blog/solutions-library.png)


Practitioners are also able to export the solution as a PDF, PNG, or Terraform Infrastructure as Code file to import into my AWS Console.

![Image](/images/blog/export-solution.png)


## Conclusion

This has by far been the most comprehensive vibe coding project I have undertaken. It is a full stack project complete with a GitHub repo updated with latest code, tests, and documentation. There are many way Teams can continue improving this project however Teams can leave that for the community to continue where I left off. Few ideas include improving solution generation with prompt caching, model switching, and direct Anthropic SDK integration instead of Vercel AI SDK. Flash Cards feature still has a known bug of not surfacing questions, instead showing answers. Solution pricing may need a dive deep if it is using the correct APIs.
