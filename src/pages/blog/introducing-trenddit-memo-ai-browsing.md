We're building something we wished existed: **turn your browsing into conversations with AI**.

Have you ever bookmarked an amazing article only to never see it again? Or saved dozens of research links that you can't remember why you found interesting? We built Trenddit Memo to solve exactly this problem.

## What Makes Trenddit Memo Different

Trenddit Memo is a Chrome extension that transforms how you interact with web content. Instead of just saving bookmarks, you can:

- 🧠 **Capture and chat**: Save content from any website and have actual conversations with it using AI
- 🏷️ **Auto-organize**: AI suggests tags and categories so you don't have to think about filing
- 💬 **Ask real questions**: "What did I save about React performance?" or "Compare the pricing I found"
- 🔒 **Keep it private**: Everything stays local unless you want to sync
- 🏠 **Run locally**: Use Ollama to keep everything on your machine

## How It Works

### 1. Capture Content with One Click

Point and click on any content you want to save. Our extension makes everything selectable:

- **Any website**: Articles, product pages, documentation, social media posts
- **YouTube videos**: Automatically captures transcripts and metadata  
- **Smart extraction**: AI pulls out titles, summaries, and key information
- **Rich context**: Saves source URL, timestamps, and site information

### 2. AI Does the Heavy Lifting

Once captured, AI immediately processes your content:

- **Auto-summarization**: Extracts key points and main ideas
- **Smart tagging**: Suggests relevant categories and labels
- **Structured data**: Identifies prices, ratings, dates, and important details
- **Context preservation**: Maintains links back to original sources

### 3. Have Intelligent Conversations

The magic happens when you start asking questions:

- **Natural language**: Ask questions like you would to a research assistant
- **Cross-content analysis**: AI connects information across multiple saved items
- **Source citations**: Every answer links back to where the information came from
- **Context switching**: Filter by tags to focus on specific topics

## Real-World Use Cases

### 📈 Investment Research
Save earnings reports, news articles, and analysis. Ask "How is Tesla performing this quarter?" and get synthesized insights from all your saved content.

### 🛒 Smart Shopping  
Capture product reviews and comparisons. Ask "Which laptop should I get based on my research?" for AI-powered recommendations.

### 📚 Learning and Development
Save tutorials, documentation, and YouTube videos. Ask "How do I optimize React components?" and get answers from your personal knowledge base.

### 📰 Staying Informed
Collect articles on topics you care about. Ask "What are the latest AI trends?" and get synthesized insights from your reading.

## Multiple AI Providers, One Interface

We support four different AI providers because everyone has different needs:

| Provider | Best For | Privacy | Cost |
|----------|----------|---------|------|
| **🤖 Anthropic Claude** | Deep analysis, complex reasoning | Cloud | ~$0.01-0.10 per request |
| **🧠 OpenAI GPT** | Creative tasks, general use | Cloud | ~$0.01-0.05 per request |
| **🎯 Google Gemini** | Speed, image processing | Cloud | ~$0.001-0.05 per request |
| **🏠 Ollama (Local)** | Complete privacy | 100% Local | Free after setup |

*Pro tip: We use different providers for different tasks. Claude for research, GPT for brainstorming, Gemini for quick questions, and Ollama for sensitive content.*

## Privacy-First Design

Your data belongs to you:

- **🔒 Local-first storage**: Everything stays on your computer by default
- **🔐 Encrypted API keys**: We never see or log your credentials  
- **📵 No tracking**: We don't collect analytics or monitor usage
- **🔄 Optional sync**: Only sync lightweight metadata if you want cross-device access
- **🏠 Complete privacy**: Use Ollama to never send data to any cloud service
